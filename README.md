# Text-Classification-on-Twitter-Dataset
Description:
This project involves building machine learning and deep learning models to classify tweets into different sentiment or topic categories using a labeled Twitter dataset.

Key Components:

Dataset: The dataset (twitter_training.csv) includes tweet texts and their associated labels (such as sentiment or topic).

Preprocessing: Text is cleaned and lemmatized using spaCy to remove stopwords and punctuation.

Feature Extraction: Text is converted into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF and tokenization.

Label Encoding: Sentiment/topic labels are encoded for modeling.

Models Used:

Classical ML models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest.

Deep Learning models: Simple Neural Network, RNN, and LSTM using TensorFlow/Keras.

Evaluation: Models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
